# pzgps
The goal of this project is to collect data from the a GPS unit and stream that data out to a web front end via a WebSocket.

We'll use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) and [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd) to read and process the data, make it available via  [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), and render in the UI with the help of [angular-websocket](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-websocket).

## Pull Requests Accepted
* If this info turns out to be useful to you, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/dankapusta)!
* I'm very open to changes/fixes/additions, please feel free to submit pull requests.

## Assumptions
You...
* Have a [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) with an [ARM11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM11) and a GPIO header soldered onto it.
* Have an [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746)
* Have [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed.
* Have [Connected your Adafruit GPS Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/using-uart-instead-of-usb)

## Project Structure

* At the root of the repo is an `index.js` file, which reads the GPS data and provides it over a WebSocket.
* A sample AngularJS app to view the data lives in the `angular1` directory.

In both locations is a `package.json` file. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies ('deps') for each part of the project. In the future, more front ends will be provided, each with their own deps to be installed (if you want to use that front end).

You'll run each part of the project by running `npm start` where the `package.json` is located.


## Installing NodeJS
The version of NodeJS you get via `apt-get install nodejs` is out of date (so you'd be missing some important security patches).

If you want to compile node from scratch on your [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) and wait all night for it to complete, then [check out this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6g53Hm0rq4).

If you want to make things a bit easier, then download the version of NodeJS you want using `wget` and install it directly. In this case we'll download the latest version for ARM on the 4.x branch...
* Log in to your pi and remain in your home directory
* `wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.6.0/node-v4.6.0-linux-armv6l.tar.xz`
* `cd /usr/local`
* `sudo tar --strip-components 1 -xvf ~/node-v4.6.0-linux-armv6l.tar.xz`
* `cd && rm node-v4.6.0-linux-armv6l.tar.xz`
* `node -v` should yield `v4.6.0`
* `npm -v` should yield `2.15.9`

Your `/usr/local` dir probably has a few files left over from the install (ie, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, README.md). You can safely remove those.


## Various Useful Commands
* `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade` to update your installed packages
* `sudo killall gpsd` - To kill gpsd
* `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart` - To elegantly restart gpsd
* `cgps -s` - to open a terminal UI for gps data
* `cat /dev/ttyAMA0` - See raw data from the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746) -


## Installing `gpsd`
Log into your pi and install `gpsd`

    sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps

Start `gpsd` in verbose/debug mode...

    sudo gpsd /dev/ttyAMA0 -D 2 -n -b -N -P /tmp/gpsd.pid -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

When starting `gpsd` you might see an error like this...

    gpsd:ERROR: can't bind to local socket /var/run/gpsd.sock

You can confirm data is coming to your [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) with `cat /dev/ttyAMA0` which should show a stream of data. If you see data coming thru but the commands to start `gpsd` failed with an error about not being able to connect, then you might have to disable terminal over serial.

## How disable terminal over serial
These didn't work, not sure why...

    sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
    sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service

What did work was...
* `sudo raspi-config`
* go to `Advanced Options`
* then `serial` and turn it off
* reboot

The Adafruit guide mentioned above says you can do this from `/etc/inittab` but that file doesn't exist in Raspbian Jessie (it did in Wheezy). Raspbian Jessie has moved everything to services and there is no `/etc/inittab` file at all, so it's best to use the `raspi-config` command.


## Configuring gpsd

To have `gpsd` start up correctly, edit `/etc/default/gpsd`

    # Default settings for the gpsd init script and the hotplug wrapper.

    # Start the gpsd daemon automatically at boot time
    START_DAEMON="true"

    # Use USB hotplugging to add new USB devices automatically to the daemon
    USBAUTO="false"

    # Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.
    # They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.
    DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0"

    # Other options you want to pass to gpsd
    GPSD_OPTIONS

    GPSD_SOCKET="/var/run/gpsd.sock"


Then restart: `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart`

Then try `cgps -s` and you should now see real data. If the GPS Breakout can't see the sky then you might see `no fix` which means it can't see any satellites. Either go outside or put the [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) on a window sill. ðŸ˜€

## GPS data via nodejs

Now that data is coming from the gps unit, thru `gpsd`, we can read that data from node with the help of [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd).

Run `npm install` to install the deps, including [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd)

This will handle the streaming of data from `gpsd` for us and provide the data as JSON (it can also start and stop the daemon, you should read the docs).

Have a look at the `index.js` in this repo and run `npm start` in your terminal. If everything is set up correctly, you should see some basic info, then a bunch of TPV events streaming by. Now you have something you can write an application around.

# Using the WebSocket from a Front End

Install `live-server` globally first (it's a webserver) by running `npm install live-server -g` in your terminal.

In the `angular1` directory, install the deps by running `npm install` then `npm start` to start the webserver. Using your web browser, navigate to your pizero's IP address on port 9001 (the default).

Assuming the millions of things above went right, you'll see some GPS data in your web browser.
