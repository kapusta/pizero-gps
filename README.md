# pzgps
The goal of this project is to collect data from the a GPS unit and stream that data out to a web front end via a WebSocket.

We'll use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) and [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd) to read and process the data, make it available via  [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws), and render in the UI with the help of [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

That data, along with user defined information, can then be saved to a [PouchDB database](https://pouchdb.com/guides/databases.html) on your browser/device that syncs to a CouchDB database on your [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/).

## Pull Requests Accepted!
* I'm very open to changes/fixes/additions, please feel free to submit pull requests.
* This project is meant to be a sandbox for learning various things, so expect things to change.
* If this info turns out to be useful to you, [please let me know](https://twitter.com/dankapusta)!

## Assumptions
You...
* Have a [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) with an [ARM11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM11) and a GPIO header soldered onto it.
* Have an [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746)
* Have [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed.
* Have [Connected your Adafruit GPS Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/using-uart-instead-of-usb)

## Project Structure
* At the root of the repo is an `index.js` file, which is a NodeJS application that reads the GPS data and provides it over a WebSocket (on port 9001).
* Sample web apps are in the `front-ends` directory, each with it's own `package.json` file.
  - Currently the [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) version of the front end has the most code/features/effort.
  - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies ('deps') for each part of the project that you want to use.
  - You'll run each part of the project by running `npm start` where the `package.json` is located.
  - All front end web apps run on port 9001.
* If you want to persist data to a database, then install CouchDB on your pizero (see below) which will run on port 5984 (the Futon UI would then be at http://yourhostname:5984/_utils/index.html).

## Installing NodeJS on the pizero
The version of NodeJS you get via `apt-get install nodejs` is out of date (so you'd be missing some important security patches).

If you want to compile node from scratch on your [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) and wait all night for it to complete, then [check out this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6g53Hm0rq4).

If you want to make things a bit easier, then [download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) using `wget` and install it directly. In this case we'll download the latest version (as of this writing) for ARM on the 6.x branch. Log in to your pi and remain in your home directory...

    wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.9.2/node-v6.9.2-linux-armv6l.tar.xz
    cd /usr/local
    sudo tar --strip-components 1 -xvf ~/node-v6.9.2-linux-armv6l.tar.xz
    cd && rm node-v6.9.2-linux-armv6l.tar.xz

Node is installed now, along with npm.
* `node -v` should yield `v6.9.2`
* `npm -v` should yield `3.10.9`

Your `/usr/local` dir has a few files left over from the install (ie, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, README.md). You can safely remove those.

Now consider installing [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) so you can easily install new versions of Node and NPM (and switch between them at will).

## Installing CouchDB on the pizero.
[The official PouchDB set up guide is excellent](https://pouchdb.com/guides/setup-couchdb.html). The Preact based front end uses PouchDB to store data locally and to persist data to the CouchDB (see below) instance.

To install CouchDB on the pizero, log into it, then...

    sudo apt-get install couchdb


## Installing `gpsd`
Log into your pi...

    sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps

Start `gpsd` in verbose/debug mode...

    sudo gpsd /dev/ttyAMA0 -D 2 -n -b -N -P /tmp/gpsd.pid -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

When starting `gpsd` you might see an error like this...

    gpsd:ERROR: can't bind to local socket /var/run/gpsd.sock

You can confirm data is coming to your [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) with `cat /dev/ttyAMA0` which should show a stream of data. If you see data coming thru but the commands to start `gpsd` failed with an error about not being able to connect, then you might have to disable terminal over serial.

### How disable terminal over serial
These didn't work, not sure why...

    sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
    sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service

What did work was...
* `sudo raspi-config`
* go to `Advanced Options`
* then `serial` and turn it off
* `sudo reboot`

The Adafruit guide mentioned above says you can do this from `/etc/inittab` but that file doesn't exist in Raspbian Jessie (it did in Wheezy). Raspbian Jessie has moved everything to services and there is no `/etc/inittab` file at all, so it's best to use the `raspi-config` command.

### Configuring gpsd
To have `gpsd` start up correctly, edit `/etc/default/gpsd`

    # Default settings for the gpsd init script and the hotplug wrapper.

    # Start the gpsd daemon automatically at boot time
    START_DAEMON="true"

    # Use USB hotplugging to add new USB devices automatically to the daemon
    USBAUTO="false"

    # Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.
    # They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.
    DEVICES="/dev/ttyAMA0"

    # Other options you want to pass to gpsd
    GPSD_OPTIONS

    GPSD_SOCKET="/var/run/gpsd.sock"

Then restart: `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart`

Then try `cgps -s` and you should now see real data. If the GPS Breakout can't see the sky then you might see `no fix` which means it can't see any satellites. Either go outside or put the [#pizero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) on a window sill. ðŸ˜€


### More useful Commands for dealing with GPSD on the pizero
* `sudo killall gpsd` - To kill gpsd
* `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart` - To elegantly restart gpsd
* `cgps -s` - to open a terminal UI for gps data
* `cat /dev/ttyAMA0` - See raw data from the [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746)


## GPS data via NodeJS
Now that data is coming from the gps unit, thru `gpsd`, we can read that data from node with the help of [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd).

Run `npm install` to install the deps which includes [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd)

This will handle the streaming of data from `gpsd` for us and provide the data as JSON (it can also start and stop the daemon, you should read the docs).

Have a look at the `index.js` in this repo and run `npm start` in your terminal. If everything is set up correctly, you should see some basic info, then a bunch of TPV events streaming by. Now you have something you can write an application around.

## Auto Start the WebSocket server at System Boot
After getting everything set up, you might want to have the WebSocket server [auto-start when your pizero boots up](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/rc-local.md).
* Look in the `package.json` file for the `scripts` section
* note the value for the `start` command
* Add that command to `rc.local` with the correct path to the `index.js` file

Your entry in `rc.local` will look something like this...

    /usr/local/bin/node /home/pi/Projects/pzgps/index.js --port 9000 &

Change the port number as needed.

## Using the WebSocket from a Front End

### Preact
Currently the [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) version of the front end has the most code/features/effort.

Install the deps by running `npm install` and run the webserver with `npm start`. There is also code linting configured using eslint which you can run with `npm run lint`.

Note the `front-ends/preact/src/lib/conf.js` file, which should be modified to match your pizero's name on your network. You can change your pizro's name by logging into the pizero, then...
* `raspi-config`
* Go to `Advanced Options`
* Go to `Hostname`
* Type in a new hostname then hit `Ok`

### AngularJS
In the `angular1` directory, install the deps by running `npm install` then run `npm start` to start the [webserver](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server). Using your web browser, navigate to your pizero's IP address on port 9001 (the default). The default port of the webserver can be changed in the `angular1/bs-config.json` file.

Assuming the millions of things above went right, you'll see some GPS data in your web browser.

### ReactJS
In the `reactjs` directory, install the deps by running `npm install` then run `npm start` to start the webserver. This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and will auto-reload your browser for you.

## Enabling a MapQuest staticmap
One of the views can load a [Mapquest "staticmap"](http://www.mapquestapi.com/staticmap/) if you have a "Consumer Key" and provide a module from the NodeJS application that includes that key.

* [Register for a developer account for free](https://developer.mapquest.com/).
* Go to your new profile, and click the "Create a New Key" button.
* You can always find your Consumer Key on the "Keys &amp; Reporting" page after creating one.
* Make a file in the `/lib` directory named `mqkey.js` and format it like the example below.

    module.exports = {
      'consumerKey': 'PASTE YOUR CONSUMER KEY HERE'
    };

On the command line you can now start the server using the `--mq` flag. An NPM command is provided in `package.json` that will start with the MapQuest module included (eg, `npm run withMapquest` will execute `node index.js --port 9000 --mq`).

Assuming all of the above is in place, the MapQuest component in the UI will receive the key over the WebSocket and use it to formulate the URL to get the static map. Because the client is receiving updates from the server continually, the map will update if the coordinates change.
