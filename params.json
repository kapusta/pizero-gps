{"name":"pizero gps","tagline":"a side project using gps on a raspberry pi zero","body":"# gps over serial on your raspberry pi\r\n\r\n## Assumptions\r\n\r\nYou...\r\n* Have a #pizero with a GPIO header soldered onto it.\r\n* Have an [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746)\r\n* Have [Raspbian Jezze](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) installed.\r\n* Have [nodejs installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).\r\n\r\nAfter you get the GPIO headers installed on the #pizero and get the pins installed on the GPS unit, connect the wires using [the Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/using-uart-instead-of-usb).\r\n\r\n## various useful commands\r\n\r\n* Kill gpsd - `sudo killall gpsd`\r\n* Elegantly restart gpsd - `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart`\r\n* Terminal UI for gps data - `cgps -s`\r\n* See data from the device - `cat /dev/ttyAMA0`\r\n\r\n## start `gpsd` in verbose/debug mode\r\n\r\nLog into the #pizero and install `gpsd`\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps\r\n\r\n...then try this command...\r\n\r\n    sudo gpsd /dev/ttyAMA0 -D 2 -n -b -N -P /tmp/gpsd.pid -F /var/run/gpsd.sock\r\n\r\nWhen starting `gpsd` you might see an error like this...\r\n\r\n    gpsd:ERROR: can't bind to local socket /var/run/gpsd.sock\r\n\r\nYou can confirm data is coming to your #pizero with `cat /dev/ttyAMA0` which should show a stream of data. If you see data coming thru but the commands to start `gpsd` failed with an error about not being able to connect, then you might have to disable terminal over serial.\r\n\r\n## Disable terminal over serial\r\n\r\nThese didn't work, not sure why...\r\n\r\n    sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service\r\n    sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service\r\n\r\nWhat did work, was turning off serial using `sudo raspi-config`, go to `Advanced Options` then `serial` and turn it off, then reboot.\r\n\r\nThe Adafruit guide says you can do this from `/etc/inittab` but that file doesn't exist in Raspbian Jesse (it did in Wheezy). Raspbian Jesse has moved everything to services and there is no `/etc/inittab` file at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Configure `gpsd`\r\n\r\nTo have `gpsd` start up correctly, edit `/etc/default/gpsd`\r\n\r\n    # Default settings for the gpsd init script and the hotplug wrapper.\r\n\r\n    # Start the gpsd daemon automatically at boot time\r\n    START_DAEMON=\"true\"\r\n\r\n    # Use USB hotplugging to add new USB devices automatically to the daemon\r\n    USBAUTO=\"false\"\r\n\r\n    # Devices gpsd should collect to at boot time.\r\n    # They need to be read/writeable, either by user gpsd or the group dialout.\r\n    DEVICES=\"/dev/ttyAMA0\"\r\n\r\n    # Other options you want to pass to gpsd\r\n    GPSD_OPTIONS\r\n\r\n    GPSD_SOCKET=\"/var/run/gpsd.sock\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen restart: `sudo /etc/init.d/gpsd restart`\r\n\r\nThen try `cgps -s` and you should now see real data appearing.\r\n\r\n# GPS data via nodejs\r\n\r\nNow that data is coming from the gps unit, thru `gpsd`, we can read that data from node with the help of [node-gpsd](https://github.com/eelcocramer/node-gpsd). This will handle the starting and stopping of `gpsd` for us and provide the data as JSON.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
