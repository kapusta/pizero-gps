## Installation

    npm install


## Development Workflow

Start a live-reload development server:**

    npm start


This is a full web server nicely suited to your project. Any time you make changes within the `src` directory, it will rebuild and even refresh your browser.

## Production build

    npm build


This will build the prod assets and put them into the `build` directory.


## Testing with `mocha`, `karma`, `chai`, `sinon` via `phantomjs`

    npm test


## Generate a production build in `./build`

    npm run build


You can now deploy the contents of the `build` directory to production!


## Start local production server with `superstatic`

    npm run prod

## Structure

Apps are built up from simple units of functionality called Components. A Component is responsible for rendering a small part of an application, given some input data called `props`, generally passed in as attributes in JSX. A component can be as simple as:

```js
class Link extends Component {
  render({ to, children }) {
    return <a href={ to }>{ children }</a>;
  }
}
// usage:
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
```

## CSS Modules

This project is set up to support [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).  By default, styles in `src/style` are **global** (not using CSS Modules) to make global declarations, imports and helpers easy to declare.  Styles in `src/components` are loaded as CSS Modules via [Webpack's css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#css-modules).  Modular CSS namespaces class names, and when imported into JavaScript returns a mapping of canonical (unmodified) CSS classes to their local (namespaced/suffixed) counterparts.

When imported, this LESS/CSS:

```css
.redText { color:red; }
.blueText { color:blue; }
```

... returns the following map:

```js
import styles from './style.css';
console.log(styles);
// {
//   redText: 'redText_local_9gt72',
//   blueText: 'blueText_local_9gt72'
// }
```

Note that the suffix for local classNames is generated based on an md5 hash of the file. Changing the file changes the hash.

## Handling URLS

:information_desk_person: This project contains a basic two-page app with [URL routing](http://git.io/preact-router).

Pages are just regular components that get mounted when you navigate to a certain URL. Any URL parameters get passed to the component as `props`.

Defining what component(s) to load for a given URL is easy and declarative. You can even mix-and-match URL parameters and normal props.

```js
<Router>
  <A path="/" />
  <B path="/b" id="42" />
  <C path="/c/:id" />
</Router>
```
